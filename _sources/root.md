# State Space Models: A Modern Approach

This is an interactive textbook on state space models (SSM)
using the [JAX Python library](https://github.com/google/jax).
Some of the content is covered in other books
such as  {cite}`Sarkka13` and {cite}`vol2`.
However, we go into more detail, and focus on how to efficiently
implement the various algorithms in a "modern" computing environment,
exploiting recent progress
in automatic differentiation and parallel computing.
