# State Space Models: A Modern Approach

This is an interactive textbook on state space models (SSM)
using the [JAX Python library](https://github.com/google/jax).
Some of the content is based on the 2013 book
[Bayesian Filtering and Smoothing](https://users.aalto.fi/~ssarkka/pub/cup_book_online_20131111.pdf)
by Simo Sarkka.
However, we also cover more "modern" material, exploiting recent progress
in automatic differentiation and parallel computing.
